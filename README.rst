django-git-lfs
==============

This is a proof of concept git-lfs storage server implementation, see:

* https://github.com/blog/1986-announcing-git-large-file-storage-lfs
* https://github.com/github/git-lfs
* https://github.com/github/git-lfs/blob/master/docs/api.md

TODO, missing features
----------------------

* Authentication
* Bind this to any real world usage
* Returning the correct HTTP status codes for responses
* Tests and documentation
* Anything besides beeing a proof of concept ;-)
